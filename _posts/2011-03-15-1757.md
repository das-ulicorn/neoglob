<p>In case I ever need this again: if your Plone Archetype has a non-standard <code>Title()</code> function, make very sure it doesn't write to the object in question.</p>

<p>The reason is that <code>deleteObjectsByPaths</code>, triggered by the delete-multiple folder button, calls <code>obj.title&amp;#95;or&amp;#95;id()</code> after the object has been deleted. If <code>Title()</code> writes to the object, you get another commit, the object isn't deleted, but the parent folder doesn't list it anymore. This is a situation which the navigation tree doesn't like at all.</p>

<p>Huh! Hah! This is me rappeling down the side of the software complexity skyscraper. (I've been at work for 11 hours now, I'm allowed to be peculiar.)</p>
