<p>Notes on Plone's shoddy CSS compressor:
it's really only a syntactical compressor, in particular:</p>

<ul>
<li>beware <code>@import</code> rules. The standard says they can only be at the beginning of a file. This will no longer be true after merging. In all fairness, you cannot fix this without changin the order in which rules occur, which changes the semantics.</li>
<li>beware <code>@charset</code> declaration. Again, this must be at the beginning of a file. The compressor also likes to wrap everything in <code>@media screen{...}</code>. Everybody is ok with that, only Safari will pout and apparently ignore <code>@media</code> blocks with <code>@charset</code> declarations?</li>
</ul>
