<p>Currently reading <a href="http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bitv_2_0/index.html">BITV 2.0</a>, the German equivalent to WCAG. "Mildly amused" by the fact I can't easily find the classification into Priority I (WCAG AA) or II (WCAG AAA) because it's not bold, it's not after each requirement, it's just something hidden somewhere in the text. I'll have to read the thing to see if maybe there's just one "Priority I" and one "Priority II", so that maybe it's meant to apply to all subsequent sections?</p>
