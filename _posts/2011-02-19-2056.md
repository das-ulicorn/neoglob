title: "It's February, I bring you links. And a rant."

<p>Renamed, because that seems to be more appropriate now. Oh, and ever since the cheezburger stuff has started doing pointless adlayer shite, I'll link to the images here directly.
<br/>
<lj-cut text="Beneath, including images">
So, not much to link.

But not much is coming my way. Apart from the score to "The internet is for porn":

A propos the recent discussion on body image, German magezine <i>Der Spiegel</i> <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,742044,00.html">reported on a student who interviewed and photographed people who had been in treatment for eating disorders</a>. Nice artful pictures, I'm not sure if it's worth running the rest through your babelfish of choice, apart from this one bit: 
<br/>
Sampson (the artist): <i>I had always planned to visit the clinic again one day. Back [when I was there myself for anorexia], I always lacked somebody coming to say "it's possible to succeed". I always read the statistics, and they look bleak. There's an oft-quoted staple amongst people with E.D., which I used to use, too: "Well, you learn to live with it." Very few believe in a total recovery. I wanted to encourage the affected.

Well, well, well, what do you expect me to say? No, you will not "recover entirely". It becomes part of your past, part of who you are, even if you don't have to watch it. Frankly, I believe that those who want total recovery have drunken the Kool-Aid of societal standards. Fuck that. Everybody who, being "entirely recovered", erases these things from their past perpetuates the thought that these are poor misguided minorities who need to be cured. Again, fuck that. I've been an active functioning alcoholic for several years, I have my share of depressive phases, including three or four attempted suicides, and my sexuality only varies in what kind of deviant it is. None of this will magically become undone. And all of these things have made me a better person, they've made me more like me, they've given me insight and serenity and humility and compassion. Maybe not enough of these, but some. And I'm not bloody going to recover from being myself, and I'm not going to say I'm sorry for that.
