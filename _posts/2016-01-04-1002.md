title: "In case I ever need this again: ePass3003"
---


<p>Feitan's ePass3003 ships with an obsolete installation routine â€“ udev rules don't look like that anymore, so the stick will appear to not be there for non-root users.</p>

<p>This is the rule you want:</p>

<pre><code>[0 1033 9:42:27] /etc/udev/rules.d % cat epass_token.rules 
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="096e", MODE=="0666"
</code></pre>
