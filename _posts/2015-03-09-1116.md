<p>Chrome has (unnoticed by me, so far, but of course I'm not ruler of the universe and they don't have to ask my permission) removed support for SVG fonts. This sucks major donkey balls, because unlike ttf/otf, you can actually handcraft (or is it handcruft?) your icon fonts as SVGs.</p>

<p>So, you used to be able to debug them in Chrome quite easily, build your demo document and reload, reload, reload, without going through font converters every time.</p>

<p>Of course, I only notice this now, when 18 months after my last change to our icons webfont, we need a new icon. Isn't it bad enough that I have to convert <code>fill</code> to reversed paths?</p>
