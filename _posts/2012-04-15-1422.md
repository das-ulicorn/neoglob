<p>After a slightly more thorough look, it appears that all attempts to have keys with the same keycode on different keyboards doing different things will fail for cross-application purposes. (I couldn't find a way to XGrabKey on a per-device basis in Xkb, and once you've grabkeyed a scancode, you can't reinject it "for security purposes", even if you decide it comes from the wrong device.</p>

<h3>But. (There's always a but.)</h3>

<p>Going one level deeper, you can reassign the scancodes. We're moving the entire problem from the X level to the kernel/evdev level. <a href="http://stew.vireo.org/blog/posts/Udev_and_multiple_keyboards/">This tut by stew</a> turned out to get me an important step further. I have now remapped the scancodes in udev, re-adapted the keycodes in my x keymap, and now xbindkeys works. For extra cleanliness, I could have aligned things properly, i.e. the scancodes have symbolic names like <code>KEY_WWW</code>, that should map to <code>XF86_WWW</code>, and maybe I could be rid of the xkm. But I couldn't be bothered.</p>

<p>Boy, that was entirely harder than neccessary.</p>
