<p>Ugh. Just downgraded my router's firmware again. Turns out the new firmware takes that slight extra amount of memory that prevents <a href="http://msdl.sourceforge.net/" title="msdl">msdl</a> from working. This is Not Acceptable(tm) since one of the main purposes of this router is to keep me supplied with BBC Radio 4Extra comedy.</p>

<p>Of course, you can downgrade. The upload mechanism will warn you, but will then ... do nothing but erase your settings. There's a complete restoration program, luckily enough, and they hadn't pulled that yet for the old firmware. It requires a wired connection (hooray, my router is deeply embedded into the case of a <a href="http://www.radiomuseum.org/r/grundig&#95;musikgeraet&#95;3040a.html">Grundig 3040a</a> along with a hard drive, an USB hub and power supply for all this) and any operating system at all, as long as it's Windows.</p>

<p>But: at the end of the day, "This is BBC London", again.</p>
