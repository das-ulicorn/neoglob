<p>I posted this before, but it deserves the distinguished place here: <a href="http://imgs.xkcd.com/blag/spirit_rewrite_unknown_author.png">an alternative take on the depressed-robot xkcd strip</a>.
<br/>
Also, <a href="http://senorgif.com/2010/10/19/funny-gifs-yoga-balls-arent-for-everyone/">A bouncy horsy</a>.
<br/>
<a href="http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/how_not_to_do_it/">Amusing blog</a>, in a trainwreck sort of way, of someone who works in biochemistry. Particularly amusing are the "stuff I won't touch" and "how not to do it" sections. As I said, a sort of scary trainwreck.
<br/>
<a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2010/10/12/samsung-galaxy-tab-features-dedicated-porn-button/">The internet is for porn</a> and Samsung finally acknowledges this.
<br/>
