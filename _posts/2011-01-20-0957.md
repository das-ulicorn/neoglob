<p>From the ever-popular intersection of "If I ever need this again" and "It only took two hours to figure out one line":</p>

<p>For archetypes-based content types, the magic incantation in your <code>profiles/default/types/mytype.xml</code> to have the type's icon actually, you know, honour the settings made in portal&#95;properties, is... <em>drumroll...</em></p>

<pre><code>python: string("${portal _url}/user.gif") if path("here/@@plone/icons&amp;#95;visible") else None
</code></pre>

<p>Because there's a good reason Archetypes does not do that implicitly and it's not because Plone devs tend to be asshats that only tailor to their own usecase.</p>
