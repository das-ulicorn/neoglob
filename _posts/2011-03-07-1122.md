<p>If I ever run amok, they'll find this blog and say "we should have known".</p>

<p>Currently tracing a bug in LinguaPlone/p.a.portlets: p.a.p.'s Navtree gives you the possibility to manually specify the root of the tree to display. This falls over as soon as you have a non-standard INavTreeRoot, which happens pretty automatically if you use LinguaPlone.</p>

<p>Up to here, it's a bog-standard bug, so fix locally, report, nothing happens, bla bla bla.</p>

<p>But: the code in question was written by an over-eager CS student and chases you through three layers of getters, a few factory abstractions which never do anything useful, and is entirely uncommented. Dude, I know I need to chop of the <code>/de/</code>, I just want to know which is the proper place to do it. Argh! <code>M-x hulk-minor-mode</code>!</p>
