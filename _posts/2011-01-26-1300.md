<p>Spent this morning and half of yesterday battling encoding and validation issues in Plone Archetypes. Hooray, utf-8 data in <code>str</code> strings galore.</p>

<p>Also, it's not easily possible to have the title (and hence the short title) of an archetype subject to validation, since renameAfterCreation comes <em>before</em> form validation. WTF?</p>

<p>(Practical application: Entry is last name, first name separately, it should be augmented by data from another database, like academical degree and office, and the title should be Degree First Last unless manually specified otherwise. The verification step is to make sure that the name is actually unique, so for my canonical example of Prof. Hanxtod, it is sufficient to enter lastname: <code>hanx</code> and everything should be fine and the rest auto-filled.)</p>

<p>The hackish solution is that the validator re-sets <code>markCreationFlag()</code> if it is not happy, so we get another call of renameAfterCreation, and if it is happy, it calls renameAfterCreation itself. Hm, in retrospect, <code>markCreationFlag()</code> might not be needed there at all. And it will cause duplicate calls to post-creation-hooks.</p>
