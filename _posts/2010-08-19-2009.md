<p>Greetings from Brighton, notes of which will be following shortly.
<br/>
The question of I can haz job? seems to be answered in the affirmative by our university's computer center, so I will probably be wrangling http://www.uni-kiel.de for the next two years.
In true academentia style, I know this not because they told me (they know I'm on holiday, and I only have a mail that the chief of operations wants me to call him back), but because I got a mail from HR that they have a new contract which overlaps with the existing one. (We discussed the possiblity of terminating existing contract early by mutual agreement.)</p>
