Cloudy yesterday, rainy today. (Blerch.) Warming up to the pebble beach, throwing grains of sand at a larger grain of sand would be much more difficult. Room still not-so-good as a hotel room, feels more like asylum seekers' temporary accomodation.
George whatshisnumber: architecturally absolutely batshit insane.
Dear change-o-mat in the arcade: please to be changing old 20 note into valid coins of the realm thankyouverymuch. Walk with a limp: tourist edition.
Bit of a down spell yesterday evening. Too many crisps: bad fat/carb/protein balance. Should probably pick up some apples, bananas and peaches for the weekend. Oh, and milk. Because whatever opinion you have about cow milk re health, it beats sucking men off behind the Amsterdam for the protein intake.

Oh, and <lj user="weegoddess">: Apparently, I've found the people who are happy with their younger years. Loads of those are spit onto the streets here every afternoon after classes, looking for a tan, a drink, a kiss on the beach, before going back home with a certificate for the other things.

PS: <lj user="redandfiery">: be afraid. Be very... well, not very. Not blue pineapple afraid. Be... mildly nervous. Be very mildly nervous? ;)</p>
