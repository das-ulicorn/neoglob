title: "Day 5: unarmed and dangerous"
---

<p>On a whim, I looked at hiking ideas provided by the council. One of them was around 9k along the River Yare to Berney's Arms. (Or rather, the other way around, but I figured I could go it the wrong way and turn back in the middle or something.)
I got past all the cows, and cow pats, without incident. Yay go me! And of course, I go all the way, and after around two hours and change (the council estimates people do around 2km/h), I'm at Berney Arms, formerly a pub, now closed. OTOH, sunshine, cows, water (and enough tide, in fact, that the picnic table I sat at a while to read at Berney Arms was in waterwhen I came back fifteen minutes later).
<br/>
On getting back to Yarmouth, I spent while in a dazed walk around Asda (but managed not to buy any donuts, even if it's two packs for a pound).
<br/>
Spent a bit of time sitting near the beach reading. (I find my left-side hamstring is giving me trouble, if I actually sit down in the sand, I might never get up again.)
<br/>
Dinner: a cheese and onion pasty. And maybe a cornish pasty later. I did not go out of Asda's bakery section empty-handed.
<br/>
Oh, and happy Talk like a pirate day, everrrrybody. Yarrrrrr!</p>
