<p>This can't be working. I think I've just strengthened a result that was known for graphs of bounded width and series-parallel graphs to graphs that do not contain an 'N' module with many children. (I.e. I treat subinstances with known results and can glue them back together.) It's scary to get a FPTAS that strong for a problem that is strongly NP-hard in the general case.</p>
