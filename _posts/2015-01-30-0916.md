<p>I think I found my first bug in CentOS/RHEL? Of course, this being the distribution it is, this bug has been <a href="https://github.com/sysstat/sysstat/commit/2eff8d176aa01780b2ae47c33df4cc78d1fc7b79">fixed three years ago upstream</a>.</p>

<p>FWIW, the bug seems to appear in RH/CentOS' 2.6.32 kernel (yes, conservative to the point of fossilized), not just in the 3.x series.</p>
