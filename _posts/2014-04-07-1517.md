<p>Moving JS to the bottom of the page to increase perceived performance. (Plone requires JQueryUI to the sound of 250kB for a i18n datepicker. Yes folks. To be fair, Mozilla is partially to blame for this, they've been dragging their feet on <code>&lt;input type="date"&gt;</code> for years and years with the excuse of "we want this to be i18n <s>and we don't have a whole calendaring software project which has already done this</s>.")</p>

<p>The hitch, or rather, the hitches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Plone has Resource Registries that do <s>breaking</s>minifying and combining of CSS and JS files for you. The default implementation is such that their output is combined, i.e. you have to patch the core mildly to leave the CSS in the head and move the JS down. Yeah, really.</p></li>
<li><p>The datepicker just blindy writes a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag into the HTML head, ignoring the resource registry, so you need to patch/bypass the jqueryui integration as well to shift that around.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and there was something else, but my mind is curled up in the corner softly chanting to itself.</p>

<p>Frameworks &mdash; we do think about these things so you don't have to. No wait...</p>
