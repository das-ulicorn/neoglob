title: "Please, somebody cheer me up."

<p>[filtered to the TMI people]
<br/>
Somebody say something positive. I've spent the weekend at my parents', cleaning out the attic. They're good at hoarding (hey, original law updates dated 1972!), and they're good at sulking, and they're good at disagreeing with other people's plans but not having alternatives. They're also good at bringing up Osnabr√ºck just when I feel vaguely relaxed.
<br/>
But this is just the background. This is the filter where you get told sordid details about me and V. after all. *sigh* I'll sum it up in some bullet points:
Bipolar mood disorder is really really not good for a relationship. Frankly, BMD is not good for anything. It's a game you cannot win, nor can anybody close to you. "Personne n'y gagnera m^eme s'il faut que quelqu'un y perde", indeed. (I'm not doing a jdev here: that's from "<s>Plus loin</s>Si le mal pouvait se taire" by Sens Unik, which I can't dig up on the pootoobe right now.) I don't know how much of this I can stand. I'm getting tired of pulling her out of one slump after the next, just until, oh, the next evening, when it all starts over again.</p>
