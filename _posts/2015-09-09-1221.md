title: "Meeep!"

<p>"My" database servers are physically moving on Friday. I've written up the failover plan, and I'm having a panic attack just looking at it.
<br/>
ETA: failover 1 successful. Twiddling my thumbs for fifteen minutes, and/or taking a toilet break. Oatbricks are wonderful, because I can barely keep anything down, MOAR CALORIES per bite are good.
<br/>
ETA2: not too surprisingly, the now-single database server is overloaded to hell, but there's not really anything I can do about that.
<br/>
ETA3: recovery 1 + failover 2 and recovery 2 successful.
<br/>
As far as I can see, the only victims of serious service interruptions were student affairs, and somebody in the humanities where the error messages always flew by too quickly. All in all, including having the servers physically moved by our chief technician, the whole thing took 3h30, we had about six or seven minutes total unavailability for network reasons during that, but frankly, apart from a small database conenct problem, everything went without a hitch.</p>
