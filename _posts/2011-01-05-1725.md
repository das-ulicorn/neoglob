<p>Next time you feel guilty about what you eat, remember this: crisps make you lose weight!
<br/>
Proof:
Lettuce, green: 13kcal/100g.
Crisps: 550kcal/100g.
<br/>
Weight gain by satisfying an assumed daily diet of 2000kcal:
Lettuce: 15300g.
Crisps:    400g.
<br/>
Congratulations, you've just avoided gaining approximately 15kg. :D

This will be updated to include a photo of the silly bucket of protein, once it's arrived. (Have you seen my bukkit?)</p>
