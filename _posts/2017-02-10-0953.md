<p>Games night A: Clash of Cultures. Yeah, nice, feels a lot like Civilization. Took about four hours though and at the end I was begging them to take my final city so I could be home by 1am.</p>

<p>Games night B: Innovation. Nice, though you probably don't want to play more than three games in a row. 3rd edition Oars seems very overpowered. In a four-player game, it practically cleaned out an age and a half with one play.</p>
