<p>Just in case I ever need this again: Plone's kupu integration will only install the proper mimetype if you enable captioning and/or link-by-uid. (I cannot be arsed to check which one.)</p>

<p>So, if you have a transform that wants to mangle text/x-safe-html, your chain of dependencies goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>a package that fixes the import handler</li>
<li>a package that configures kupu</li>
<li>a package that installs your transform.</li>
</ol>

<p>In particular, you need a dependency between the last two to make things work, even though it doesn't involve Kupu at all. Daaaaaaaaaaargh!</p>

<p>PS: I'm pretty high up in Google for "Just in case I ever need this again". :D</p>
