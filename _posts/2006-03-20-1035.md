Theorem of Gibbard and Sutterthwaite (very paraphrased, the formal statement <i>is</i> gibberish): in a voting system with at least three parties where any party could be elected, and any voter can vote for any party, and it is not detrimental to vote for the party you like best, there is one voter that always gets his will, no matter what he votes for.
