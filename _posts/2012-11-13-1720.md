<p>$interimboss has done it again. It's OK to say I should go to a meeting with the uni's campus management software provider, because they want us to use their portal functionality and I am one of the two webpeople here. But it's not effin' OK to tell me on the morning about a meeting in the afternoon ($ib knows I come in at dark o'clock and leave early) and not tell me it's a bloody two-day affair! The FOOOOOOOORQ!
<br/>
This is me, drinking the rest of my coffee after having been here for 10:30, of which productive: 2.
