<p>No new boar pictures this week, sorry, everybody.
<br/>
But I set a new record on being a weirdly ocd person: there's a few bicycle sign paths about half a mile off the botanic gardens, well away from any place I might come past in my daily wanderings, other than weekend walks. And these signposts have apparently been in a collision a few years back. Now that they're not exactly upright anymore, they gather moss on the face of the sign. So I went and sprayed windex at them (can't wipe them because they're about 10ft up, even I can't reach). Let's see if that helped a little.</p>
