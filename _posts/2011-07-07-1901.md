title: "There should have been other stuff here, but it isn't."

<p>Because random minutiae can't be justified when today is the day I am mourning for a dear friend, <lj user="mhw">. How selfish humans can be, that I wish he were still alive to make our days brighter, when he has been relieved of a life that was not always easy, or free of doubt. A lover of music, speaker of many tongues, "a brain the size of a small planet" as he was once described to me: a scholar in the best sense of the word. Caring, compassionate, charitable and the occasional shameless flirt, I find it difficult to believe there could be anyone who knew him whose life has not been made richer by it. His work follows and precedes him, and there is no doubt in my mind that he will find rich reward in the afterlife. Wherever he is, I'm not sure they are prepared for it.</p>
