<p>Short update: tonight's dinner with P. and E. was <i>Holsteiner RÃ¼benmus</i> (which is essentially swedes, carrots and potatoes cooked and mashed into a very thick stew and eaten with a variety of fatty pork cuts) and an elderberry soup wth semolina dumplings for dessert, so very locally traditional all in all. I'm so not stepping on the scales today.
<br/>
Ents: <i>Secretary</i>. Which they took remarkably well, even though they're mundanes. (It's funny: I used to be the boring, least freaking partying guy through my teens and twens, and I'm the plainest guy at BiCon, but in my early-to-mid-30s peer group here, I'm suddenly the slightly odd scruffy queer alternative guy.) But we all agree the guy who wrote the blurb didn't watch the movie. And WTF it's not a comedy. But the combination of psychologically brittle people and bdsm doesn't squick me as much as it did when I first saw it three years ago.</p>
