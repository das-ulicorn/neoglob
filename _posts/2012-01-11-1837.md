<p>Things I learned myself today: in Grails, overwriting the getter of an attribute will prevent the setter from being auto-generated. This in turn sets the property's <code>persistent</code> flag to <code>false</code>, removing it from consideration for scaffolding and JSON/XML serialization.
(You still get it by calling the appropriate getPersistentProperty(String name) on the domainClass, because that actually looks at the wrong map.</p>
