<p>in pineapple, mango and cucumber salad, make sure that the mango is ripe. I like my fruit on the firm side, but this mango is about as firm as a Granny Smith apple.
If you're stuck for ideas for a dressing (and out of grapefruit juice, which is what Lisa and I used last time), I'm currently trying pineapple syrup (from the tin) with a shot of Campari, and that seems to work quite well. Might need a shot of cider vinegar, too.
This salad would benefit from more than 42F and drizzle outside, too. Just sayin'.</p>
