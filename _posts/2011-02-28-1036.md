<p>Why yes, isn't it totally obvious that the proper sequence in object creation is:</p>

<ol>
<li>call constructor four times</li>
<li>call entry validation routine twice</li>
<li>call constructor again</li>
<li>call "post-creation" hook</li>
<li>call entry validation routine again</li>
<li>call constructor</li>
</ol>

<p>Dude WTF, if I had to design something to make sure that neither the entry validation routine nor the post-creation hook nor the constructor can be used for anything useful, I'd do somthing like this.</p>
