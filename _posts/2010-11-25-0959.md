<p>Somebody's going to hell for this, I sure hope it's not me.</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;tal:custom
       tal:define="f context/@@custom; fp f/virtual _url _path;
             pu context/@@plone _portal _state/portal _url;"&gt;
    &lt;script tal:content="string:rooturl='$pu';"&gt;
      rooturl = "";
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/tal:custom&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Really, though, has anybody managed to do anything useful with Plone Resources? Since you can only adress them absolutely, you cannot use them in CSS for background images (since DTML is a booboo and you cannot get the portal&#95;url into them otherwise), and without the above trickery, you cannot do stuff like jQuery.getScript() with them either.</p>
