<p>My mind is currently stuck on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9gOQgfPW4Y">MARRS</a>. Hey, don't judge me, I grew up with animations of sat solar sails unfolding, and the occasional newspaper piece on where Voyager 2 currently was. I remember being on vacation at my grandma's place when Challenger exploded, the booster rockets making the thing look like a perverse caterpillar made of steam and dead astronauts.</p>

<p>I guess in retrospect, you can say it was obvious that I'd end up in IT, with its tiny automation steps unfolding, trying to build order in a world that is mad chaotic.</p>
