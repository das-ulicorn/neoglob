title: "F-in' keys!"

<p>Apparently, XFCE's window manager has a bug where keyboard shortcuts are assigned to scancodes, not X key events. This is unfortunate, as my extra numpad (see previous post) generates decimal 0-9, not even kp0-9. (Admittedly, this error is impossible to spot unless you connect two keyboards with different configurations <em>in their non-alnum keys</em>, which is pretty rare.)</p>

<p>But I can still assign within the application. Well, not in LibreOffice, because LO has a fixed list of keystrokes you can assign things to. Yes, everybody, they give you a big list from Ctrl-A to Ctrl-Shift-Z and that's it. My manic cackling at this cack is only interrupted by my forehead hitting the desk.</p>

<p>Well, it's xbindkeys then, I guess.</p>
