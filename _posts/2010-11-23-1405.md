<p>Trying to change the default to suppressing parent portlets in Plone. The architecture is absolutely fucking insane, passing through four levels of indirection and sending you through two entirely different namespaces.</p>

<p>The real fun bit is: it is impossible to justify that this takes the amount of work it does, because there's a TTW selection box for it. (Why a combo box for a boolean property, I don't know.) But the mortals will point and say "Oh look there's a box already, so it must be all there". Only the box is full of bees. Argh!</p>
