<p>An ingenious way of doing things was just discovered in a PHP template engine that shall rename nameless (let's call them <code>PrecipitationTpl</code>): the compiled files' name includes a hash over the config of the engine. Well, not just the settings, but also the order in which settings are applied. </p>

<p>So, not only does rearranging the order of orthogonal settings invalidate all your compiled templates, but also, adding new settings, like, say, "don't try to recompile templates" change the hash and you end up with big messy exceptions.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the code is mostly simple enough and small enough that these things can be found by sourcediving.</p>
