<p>Now that was a dessert that wasn't half as bad as it sounded: simmer 7 peeled and coarsely chopped kiwifruit with 5 tbsp sugar and 200ml water for about half an hour. Add 200ml of orange juice and 80g of couscous. Cook for two or three minutes. Leave to cool, then mix with 200ml of firmly whipped cream. Eat soon, because like risotto or porridge, it will turn into the consistency of wet clay.
<br/>
The kiwis retain a little crunch (especially the pips), which combined with the cream is for some reason vaguely reminiscent of meringue. It's nice, just don't tell people it's couscous, because they'll say they don't like it. (The original recipe called for wheat semolina, but I'd vaguely guess semolina -> couscous -> bulgur is just increasing coarseness. Also, I just happen to have excessive amounts of couscous around. I hear you can also make pizza dough with it.)
<br/>
What do we learn from this? Couscous cooked in fruit juice: sounds weird and nasty, is actually tasty. (Oh Kamikaze cookery, how we long for thee.)</p>
