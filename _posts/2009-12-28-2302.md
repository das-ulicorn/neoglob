<p>I know, it's early, I blame daylight savings time.

<lj-cut text="last year">
Last year this time, I was sliding from one depression into the next. In that regard, things have been reasonably well over the past months. Some publications have helped. I've paid some price for success, though, being even less sociable than ever, to the detriment of people dear to me whom I've known for pretty much a decade now. I don't even seem to have hobbies left. My TeXing has died off a little due to lack of time, I'm buying Battletech stuff more for nostalgia than anything else, my fancy-ish shortwave receiver hasn't wandered  off into the sidebands for ages. I'm watching more telly than before. Must be getting old, which is not so bad. There's people around on campus that don't even look overage to me. Yeah, definitely getting old. Turn down that music and get off my lawn.

Next year, I will be working someplace else. I'll worry about that when I get there. When I started my Ph.D., I had hopes of a future, if not a career, in academentia, but I do not want to spend my future fscking over the students because, at the end of the day, research and grant money are all that counts here. I hope I'll be leaving with a Dr. to my name. I love the teaching, I feel the major reason I cannot spark the students like I used to is that I've sold out after all: it's the grade on the diploma, and that, too, takes time. And that would not be going away any time soon, because you're under permanent evaluation for research success until you're a full professor, at which point you're employed for life [and a shooting star if you're only 40 at that point]. I'd rather have an honest job.
<br/>
A semi-marathon would be nice. It feels far away right now because my ankle is still being obstinate, but that is temporary. Going from my current fitness levels, I'll hopefully be somewhere in the 1:30 to 1:59 range. No, it's not solving the problem underneath. I don't care. Measurable numbers and a little arrow next to them reading "shorter is better/longer is better": it's as close to happy as I can get.
<br/>
Personal life, I don't expect anything major to happen there. I can't say I have much libido these days, nor do I miss it. The physicalities of intimacy seem more like a weird in-joke every day, and I'm not in on it. Other things, I miss more, but people are people and not pick'n'mix shelves. (This is not the time to tell me about your fizzy stick fetish, it really isn't.)
Everybody else seems to be spawning like nobody's business here. Rest confident that I'll be here to talk about a sedate single life next year this time.
<br/>
Spiritually? There are body issues. There are sexuality issues. I am sort-of embracing my sexuality [insert stupid "it's not that big around, one hand's enough" joke here], but why would I bother others with it? Yeah, I'm not exactly good at not bothering you, point taken. If I can find the time for my soul somewhere, I'll be taking it.
<br/>
Travel? There's Athens in January, Munich in February. Hopefully Lausanne in the summer, fingers crossed for my submission to the conference there. Blackpool in August, maybe, because I'm a boring cheapskate fart and somehow, I like the place, even though I'm not a people person and it doesn't feel particularly safe after sundown. Also, I'm running out of Marmite and brown sauce, so there. BiCon? Maybe. It feels like a bad omen to make plans for it now: the last time it was in London, I was too busy having a plastic bag over my head to show up, and I'd rather not tempt fate.
