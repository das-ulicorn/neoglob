<p>OK, you're on the TMI filter :)
<br/>
I am avenged in retrospect: I have spent years conditioning myself, figuring sex would not play a big role in my life. Huzzah, I have succeeded!
<br/>
<lj-cut text="and this is why">
V. and I seem to have this relationship thing backwards (apart from the strap-on bit): she's the one rushing me, and I'm the one saying that it's not problem, there's no such thing as "too early" and that it doesn't matter if I don't have an orgasm. (Yeah, so I get a feeling of stifled blood flow in all limbs at once, but we were absolutely unable to coax a shot, neither Friday nor yesterday, manually, orally or vaginally. Go me. I have no idea. Maybe my little friend is not accustomed enough to latex [I can't even type that without mixed-case], will try rubbers for allergic people. She's suggesting we could try without, but I'm going nowhere near that road, and I don't think I can trust somebody who truts me in that matter.)

Oh yeah, and while the scratched-back thing is nice, I don't think I can do this all the time. But watching "The IT Crowd" in bed together is very nice. (We'll need to work on the duvet habits, though. And if she's complaining about 19C room temperature, what will happen in winter, when I let it drop to 15?)
<br/>
Well, that's, in brief, last friday, and yesterday.</p>
