<p>Down four lbs of weight. (Though some of that will be flight-induced dehydration: the so-called BA flight was a codeshare with flybe, so no complimentary drinks. Bah. Lufthansa all the way, baby.)
Lost a bunch of purity points. Let's call it the Kay Dekker Memorial Fuck. I think he'd approve.
Some people have impressive abs. (Given that I was at that time being impressed² by other bodyparts, I am not talking lightly here)
<br/>
² is it "a punnet of wordplays"?
<br/>
And no, I don't know why I don't refer to it as BiCon even in f/only posts. I'm not sure I even have straight people on my flist :D
<br/>
ETA: And so I sit, with the usual bind: I don't have enough socialising cutlery to do a whole BiCon really. But I can't drop in for a day, because on one side of it, there's a 7-hour journey to Germany. And I do want to have the theoretical possibility of going to the ents. (Yeah, I'm not fooling anybody, am I?) Or, you know, spending time with people (Still not fooling anyone...) without checking my watch all the time. What's the seaside resort closest to Bradford anyway.
ETA: Scarborough. I'm not sure if my silly joke covers resorts without piers, though.</p>
