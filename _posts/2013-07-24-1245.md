<p>You can't have composite command objects. Or rather, you can, but since command objects are not even by-convention, but by-position (arguments to actions), if you have</p>

<pre><code>class CompoCommand {
    FooCommand foo = new FooCommand();
    FooCommand bar = new BarCommand();
}
</code></pre>

<p>you <em>do</em> get binding, but you don't get dependency injection. Not for your own services, not for defaultish properties like <code>errors</code>. So, hooray, if you have complex forms ("use these checkboxes to delete your profile on several StackExchange sites at once"), you have roughly zero code re-use. <em>D</em> R Y !</p>
