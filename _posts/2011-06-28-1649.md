<p>In case I ever need this again: it appears that 
<code>wget -S -O /dev/null --header 'Cache-Control:no-cache' &lt;URL&gt;</code> will not only bypass Apache's mod&#95;cache as obvious, but on the way back, Apache will refresh its cache with the new content. (So, this is a way to force refreshing stale cache content. Yes, it shouldn't happen, but yes, it does. Proxying for Plone comes to mind.)</p>
