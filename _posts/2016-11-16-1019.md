title: "Some days, I love myself."

<p>I just found this left to me by myself in an internal workflow:
<br/>
<pre>
Mass update steps
Updating now, cross your fingers and hold on to your hats
<br/>
/preptest
    cau201y.editors:default ... done
    cau201y.theme:default ... done 
</pre>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I didn't tell myself how to hold the hat with crossed fingers.</p>
