title: "More F-in' keys"
---


<p>Turns out that xbindkeys is not xkb-enabled, neither is fluxbox' fbkeys, nor XFCE. At least, not in the way I require here: with my setup, keycodes map to different keysyms depending on their device, which means that any program calling <code>XKeycodeToKeysym</code> is living in a state of sin and gets it wrong.</p>

<p>So far, Emacs is the only application I've found to get it right. <em>sigh</em></p>

<p>On the other hand, xbindkeys is small enough to be understood, so I can maybe patch that to work. Geeeeeeeeeeeeek powaaarrrr!</p>
