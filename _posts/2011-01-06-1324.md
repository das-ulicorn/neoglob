<p>Just in case I  ever need this again: Kupu doesn't register its import/export steps properly in Plone 4.0.2, hence it doesn't look at settings in profile/default/kupu.xml. Also, be advised that kupu.xml is pretty much the only GS setup file where you cannot just add entries. From my somewhat limited understanding of GS and importexport.py, you have to have all the entries, <code>&lt;library&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;resource&gt;</code>, etc etc etc.
Damn, that only took half a day to find out.</p>
