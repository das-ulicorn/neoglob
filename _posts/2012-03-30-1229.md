<p>Why does every bloody software have to use its own bloody templating language? Just for our postmasters, I'm looking at a way to accomodate TT2 (Perl, for Sympa), something proprietary (PHP, for Roundcube), probably JSTL (Java, for Bedework). Really, proxy-side XSLT transformation is looking more tempting by the minute.</p>
