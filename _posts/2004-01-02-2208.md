<p>Why is it that the first thing people do when they hear that I'm bi is start citing examples of how they're so OK with it, and how their current flatmate is a lesbian, and how it's so wonderful and everything?

<b>I don't fscking care!</b> You can think about what I -- in principle -- do in bed with people of what plumbing configuration whatever you want. You will find that I have very little to say to you if you don't have the basic sense of modesty to not tell me into the face I should be gassed. Otherwise from that, I don't give a fscking damn!

It's not like being non-heterosexual automatically makes you a very soft and fragile person that needs to be agreed with under all circumstances.

Frankly, I don't care if you once sat next to a gay person in a bus. I am not telling you I'm bi because I'm in dire need of supportive hugglage. I'm telling you because you were confused by the fact that I have a boyfriend. Sheeesh, get a grip already!</p>
