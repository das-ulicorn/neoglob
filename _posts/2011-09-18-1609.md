<p>Sunday afternoon in a dependency chart.</p>

<p>pcmanfm 0.99... requires libfm... libfm lives on sourceforge... but no! ... releases live hidden in a pcmanfm subtree ... libfm requires menucache ... menucache lives somewhere in the LXDE project ... configure, make, install menucache. configure, nowait, configure depends on the doc directory and libfm doesn't have one. Go get one from an older release, configure, make, install libfm. configure -- wait, I just did install ... turns out it installs with non-standard dirs, so you need to pass a bunch of options to configure. configure, make, install. configure (with bunch of options), make, teststart... libs not found. Add a bunch of symlinks. teststart... window comes up. Click help/about: nothing happens, apart from a bunch of failed assertions. Remove symlinks, say fuck you, make coffee, say fuck you again for good measure, write a cursy blogpost and go for a walk.</p>
