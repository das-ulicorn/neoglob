<p>I had to wrangle PowerShell for the first time today, for some noddy problem. (Drag files onto script, script mangles them and creates new file with name that takes an explicit mapping from a <code>csv</code> file.</p>

<p>The result only took about 30 lines, (I could've done it in 15 on a standard Linux userland, I guess, but that's not where it will run), and my preliminary verdict is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PowerShell feels like the bastard lovechild of Python and jQuery with sprinklings of <code>test(1)</code> and Perl.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seriously, just when you find that <code>foreach($y in $list)</code> works, <code>if $y in $hash</code> doesn't (have to use <code>contains_key</code>) and what do you mean, your logical AND operator is not <code>&amp;&amp;</code> but... <code>-and</code>?</p><ul class="filed-as"><li>learning something new every day</li></ul>
