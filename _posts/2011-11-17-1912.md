<p>You know bad puns are a bad sign. It's been that kind of week, yeah. But the weekend seems to be approaching, foreshadowed by <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0175m69">The men from the ministry</a>.
<br/>
I've not been sleeping well for the past few days, with a smattering of earworms as well. Tuesday was "30 days in the hole" (all I need is my laaaaaaaawyer!1!!), Wednesday was "Tear the roof off this sucker" (we need to funk, can I have the funk?! I want to sleep, can I have some sleep?) For tonight, I'm setting myself up to Warren Haynes' "Man in Motion":

and fondly imagine a small "hell yeah" thought bubble rising from L's head. Because I think that's totally the kind of person she is. :)

<br/>
Work has been a bit of a drag. I'm wrestling Grails for our database frontend, and it consistently manages to get it 80% right and fuck-near impossible to do the remaining 20%. Like yeah, we can reverse-engineer our sorta-legacy database with ~35 tables. Apart from one place where we'd like to join on a column that is not ID. (And bloody hell, I'm not using a convention-over-configuration framework to write Hibernate XML mappings.)
And it does subclass-in-big-table thing nicely, only the subclasses' custom views don't get called for HTML, but the extra attributes do get shown in JSON and XML.
And you can sort-of hack composite primary keys, but I cannot refactor out the key generator into a common superclass because the methods are only added at runtime.
So I'm going through a lot of sweets at work.
<br/>
Speaking of which, Sunday's dessert was dulche de leche with almonds in puff pastry, which is the only substance known to humankind that might be less healthy than deep-fried arse bars.
<br/>
And now for something completely different:
<br/>
Next week's Women's Hour Drama is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017cb09">How does that make you feel?</a> (I will not mock the title. Humanities are a perfectly valid field which I just happen to Entirely Not Get.)
<br/>
Book at bedtime is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b017cmgh">Perfect Lives</a>, which I mostly mention here because the "themes of imperfection, compromise and the joy of accepting life as it is" are a topic I hold close to my soul.
<br/>
Over on BBC4x, we'll have <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tvk9s">more Lucifer Box: The devil in Amber</a>, and if you missed it two months ago, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0178f6c">On the Edge</a> is on again.
<br/>
(I really need to get elocution lessons so you can imagine me saying all that in a deep crisp announcer's voice.)
<br/>
What, incoherent, me? I'm just too tired to close my eyes.</p>
