<p><lj-cut text="And I thought not drinking would stop be from ranting">
Up to New Year's Eve, 17:00, I was getting well on with my plan to put
relationships and various stuff that is concerned with what lies
beneath the underwear right between beer, cat litter and sanitary
towels in the great supermarket that is life, in that aisle that is
marked "stuff that does not concern me".
<br/>
<i>Not so fast</i>, says fate, and sends along a friend's girlfriend
to not only talk away the evening with me over sex (why, I have no
idea; we had a brief banter about her underwear when we first met and
somehow she won't talk about anything else with me) but as well make
assorted incredulous noises as to my lack of sexual experience and
partners that are on the same continent.
<br/>
Yes, dammit, I do look in the mirror, and I do know what I look like,
thankyouverymuch, and I am prepared to immediately and doubtlessly
believe that you think that sex is great, my lashes long and my lips
luscous, <b>but I don't fscking want to hear about it!</b>
<br/>
I don't know what annoys me more about this - her, albeit
well-meaning, dragging up of stuff that I was hoping I could settle
conveniently with the occasional 75-second maneuver or my apparent
inability to say "Uh-huh", let her words blow in my left ear (as it
were) and out of my right one off into the alcohol-saturated air of a
basement room instead of getting more-or-less confused, distracted and
whine all over LJ about it.
