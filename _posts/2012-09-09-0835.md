<p>This year's shirt is a nurgle-ish day- (and night-, too, most likely) glo green.
<br/>
There's still that moment of umph when I fill out the back of the runner's number sheet: blood group, phone# of next of kin ... I hear we used to have full marathons here, but it became infeasible for insurance reasons.
<br/>
My last bit of training yesterday morning went absolutely horribly crap, but I think (hope!) this is mostly an anxiety and pressure thing. I can do this. I just really need to not look at the total time (beyond the 2:30:00 cutoff).
<br/>
Didn't sleep all that well, in spite of the entire street being quiet, apart from one silly soul singing along to the first line of something over and over again. But no beat.
<br/>
It's overcast, and doesn't seem warm enough to enjoy this, in spite of what the thermometer and forecast are saying. (I used to be hardcore enough to train starting at 5°C. Now, 17°C doesn't look inviting.) But I guess I'll get warm eventually.
<br/>
ETA: 1:49:14, down ca. 2 minutes vs two years back.</p>
