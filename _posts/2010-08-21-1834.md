<p>Quick, somebody pry these digestives from my hands! (Didn't they use to come also in a non-choc variety?)
Got myself some apples, pears and two grapefruit, four pints of milk, cookies and muffins[1]. Oh, and books[2]. Now for all I care, it can rain all day tomorrow. I'll just stay in and eat myself silly.
<br/>
Also paid my respecs to the LGBT memorial tree in St.Ann's Well park today. I think. I suck at biology, but it was the only tree that remotely looked like a weeping cherry. Also, it had a semicircle of older trees looking down on it.

[1] Muffins do not come in flavours in Germany. So, no cheese and onion muffins, no cinnamon muffins. I'm sure somebody in Brighton does Cinnanomnom muffins, because that's the kind of joke it is. Pieminister, I'm looking at you. ETA2: I have to correct my statement: Rosinenbr√∂tchen might technically count as currant muffins. But the kind of to-be-toasted english muffins only exists in an unflavoured variety and avoids the term muffin.
<br/>
[2] Interesting to see The Works is still trying to flog the books I bought two years back. Well, not the porn one. Good opportunity to catch up on Jason Bourne.
<br/>
ETA: Why are apple cores so lonely? Because they don't come in pears. =D</p>
