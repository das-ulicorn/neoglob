OK, so Vermobbengel dropped by on Tuesday, just because, and we had a nice chat and we had all the right things going (pointing of knees, eye contact, moving closer, huggin goodbye). OK, I'm not hallucinating here, but I'm not trying to push anything either. Yeah, OK, I did check the expiry date on the condoms I have around, but that's just because I'm a bloke and I'm possibly not exactly about to say no. In the process, I found some lemongrass massage oil from way back when in '99? 2000? This will become important.
<br/>
I spent the evening barking up the wrong tree (I knew V. was going to Kungfu training, and I suspected they were going to place X, but they weren't, so I went over to the only dojo I know off the top of my head, which was the wrong one.)
<br/>
V. says training went unusually well (she walked around last week with bruised knuckles, so there), just a little muscle pain from the leg work.
<br/>
I'm lacking a proper adjective for offering a massage to her. I think I have successfully scared myself now. I'm afraid to look at my inbox.

Eh, I guess either way I'm screwed.</p>
