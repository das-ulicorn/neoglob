<p>What "object" can mean in Plone:</p>

<ul>
<li>traversing into object</li>
<li>calling default&#95;view of object</li>
<li>calling object as a method</li>
<li>apparently, string coercion in some places</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, you can define these separately. My calloused brain, let its shell rest gently in my weary hand.</p>
