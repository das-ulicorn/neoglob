<p>Can we just doublecheck that there's a difference between "I have stuff to do and I need some time to myself¹, so can we see each other wednesday" and "You're just being dumped"? My, that was an hour or two of drama that was completely unneccessary.

Frankly, she's in more risk of this ending quickly now that before that, if I have to go through the boo-hooing just because I don't strictly want to spend every free minute I have with her. I don't think this relationship will last the winter. Which doesn't bother me that much, but she appears to have more emotional investment into this thing than me. (This in itself is a crisis just waiting to happen. To me, it's a flirt that has gone wrong (in a pleasurable way). She makes it sound like I'm Prince Charming with a white steed.) *sigh*
<br/>
Oh, and on the saucy details: still the occasional erectile problem, still not getting off. She seems to be enjoying it, though.
<br/>
OK, on the plus side, I have a Onion Tart in the oven (because if I get a day off her, I might as well eat something that won't admit naked light in the bedroom), some cheap cola and ghastly beer. (Warsteiner non-alc, in case you're curious. Skip that one, it's unpalatable.)

¹because a good little fellow always wears a hat when he steps inside, and trying otherwise might look like a sign of trust to you, it's not to me. Frankly, I am fuming mad in a way. Ever since when does "no means no" only go one way?</p>
