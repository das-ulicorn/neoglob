<p>Well, it looks like <a href="http://www.aaronbarker.net/2010/07/diagonal-sprites/">Aaron Barker</a> beat me to it. Still, I didn't know it yet, and now I have the silly grin that you get when you pull off a stunt: if you arrange images diagonally in a CSS sprite, <em>all</em> of them will have nothing below and to their right. 
Bullet power, baby! And yet another reason to automate my sprite building. (The other one is that I'm stuck with an aaaaancient version of GIMP at work which likes to crash on saving GIFs with transparency.)</p>
