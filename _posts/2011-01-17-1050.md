<p>I have one word for you: <code>border-color:transparent</code>. OK, that's two words. I feel ... dirty now, but it works even in IE and saves me from having a separate set of CSS sprite offsets.</p>

<p>(Background: the origin for <code>background-image</code>s is outside <code>padding</code>, so changing <code>padding</code> is bad, but <code>margin</code> is not part of the <code>:hover</code>-aware region. Setting <code>border</code> doesn't change the origin of <code>background-image</code>, but behind <code>border:transparent</code>, you still see the elements' own <code>background-color</code>.</p>
