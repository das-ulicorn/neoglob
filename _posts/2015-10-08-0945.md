title: "How not to do it."

<p>The Plone team <a href="https://plone.org/products/plone-hotfix/releases/20151006">recently released</a> a security "patch".</p>

<p>Issue: Plone's backend database access interfaces have no CSRF protection. It has been well-known best practice for years to protect access to the database backend by standard methods (firewall, proxy through a web server with access control).</p>

<p>The backend, along with the database and infrastructure, is part of an upstream project. So, instead of pushing the bug upstream, what do they do? Hey, they patch the HTTP server component: every page delivered, and this includes pages that have been put there as dumb files, is <strong>parsed again</strong> (!!), checked for presence of <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag, the action is checked against a <strong>hardcoded</strong> (!!) list of exempt forms, otherwise, a token field is added. The result is shipped.</p>

<p>Part of the parsing process normalizes the document to be ASCII. It is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#characters">perfectly legal</a> to have high-UTF characters in class names. Only, of course, <code>.ö</code> is a valid class name, and <code>.&amp;#246;</code> is not. Nevermind the transform also reflows parts of the sourcecode.</p>

<p>So you're breaking pages left right and center because you couldn't be bothered to push a patch upstream? (Of course, part of the problem might be that you're using a maybe not all that recent version of the framework either…)</p><ul class="filed-as"><li>not loving Plone</li></ul>
