<p>Moving office today, because former coworker is shifted to the department on the other side of the floor. (My, the amounts of cr..uft that accumulate in an office.)

Quote of the day:
"Peace. It does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise, trouble or hard work. It means to be in the midst of those things and still be calm in your heart."
