title: "Notes on a humid Friday evening."

<p>The hot and sunny week is coming to an end with the inevitable discharge of electricity. And somewhere, I fear (for lo! things were better in my days and get off my lawn you kids), some toddler is pointing at the bluish reflections in the night sky and saying "look dada, god's got the telly on". (Bonus tangent: while mistaking (or not?) television as a religious icon of worship is a common motif for the "what will archaeologists think about us x-thousand years down the line" genre, how about traffic lights? Some weird part of me can see them trying to associate the changing of the lights as symbolic of the changing of the seasons, after all, they'll know the climate pre-collapse was somehow different but maybe not exactly how.)
<br/>
Speaking of inevitable discharge, a screamer has moved in somewhere in my street.
<br/>
And thirdly, wtf? I am totally not used to people pretending to be amused by my jokes, particularly not people of the "former coworker of former coworker who were just sitting in the cafe" variety. (The fact that I can't garnish this with a name should probably tell you everything.)
<br/>
Oh dear. I'm so incoherent I could probably stop a laser. Better go lie nudely on the bed now, moonlight playing over the buttocks safely prevented by the aforementioned tellyclouds. Sleep tight, everyone.</p>
