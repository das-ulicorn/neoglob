<p>Hooray, so you've decided to overhaul your theming system. The new one eschews practically all previous methods the CMS had (that is <em>at least</em> two), and essentially merges layout dummy and content page with an XSLT-like dialect.</p>

<p>Only then you realize, "hey, the old system had machanisms for merging and compressing CSS and JS!" (Your minification mostly erased whitespace, which is lost in the noise when you gzip anyway, also, it would sometimes not work, leading to user errors, but let's not quibble.)</p>

<p>So, obvious solution: you have a new system. You still recommend that all resources are registered in the old system, and people should stick in a rule to drop CSS/JS from the dummy and reinsert the compruppted ones. Yeeeeeeah, riiiiiiight...</p>
