<p>Found the update to Plone 4.3.4 by pure chance today. (Released on Friday, no announcements made in the RSS feed, not linked form the project page.)</p>

<p>As part of 4.3.4, plone.app.portlets comes with a new portlet, the Action portlet. But I shouldn't say "comes", because while the code is there, they don't provide the configuration handwavium that enables it on new installations, nor the handwavium that enables it on updates. Thank you, idiots.</p>
