<p><em>The quest for a faster startup, part III</em></p>

<p>What I've done in the meantime: I now have a <code>etc.tar.gz</code> living in <code>/</code> which is unpacked into a ramdisk early in the start process. (Exact instructions to follow.)
This might have saved me as much as 2 seconds in the overall start process. I say might, because in the meantime, I also upgraded to 13.37, which also involved re-building my custom kernel. Let me note that: I think the major speedups are from having a custom kernel with stuff you need built-in and everything else not (saving initialisation and probing overhead for all the other stuff in the -huge kernel and saving disk seeks for modules) and from avoiding the safety sleeps in the init scripts.</p>
