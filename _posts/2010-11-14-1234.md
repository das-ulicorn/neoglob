<p>Hooray! It appears to be working. So this means I turned a rainy sunday productive by</p>

<ul>
<li>nerding around on stackoverflow and tex.stackoverflow</li>
<li>hacking up a small blog so I don't clutter my livejournal with the boring nerd stuff</li>
<li>putting a malt loaf in the breadmaker</li>
</ul>

<p>and there's still plenty of time to take over the world! </p>
