title: "The great potato experiment of 2015"

<p>So I made what is probably best described as a potato quiche.
<br/>
Case: boil and grate five large-ish potatoes, add some salt and paprika.
<br/>
Filling: gently fry five onions, roughly sliced, with paprika and caraway seed. Add 100g of diced bacon later on and continue frying. Also add about 100g of soft cheese (in my case, a chepa camambert-ish thing).
Mix 150g of sour cream with two eggs and plenty of paprika, mix in onions, bacon and cheese, pour into case, bake for 40 minutes at 200C.
<br/>
The result is edible -- the filling turned out to be a pretty straightforward Zwiebelkuchen for those of you familiar with that, but the case is very bland. (Without frying, the potatoes are more a dumplingy thing than a latke-ish thing, and somewhat disappointing.)

So, people who cook more than me, so all of you basically, how do I get more flavour into my grated potatoes? Should I try grating some Emmental or Tilsit into the potato mix next time?</p>
