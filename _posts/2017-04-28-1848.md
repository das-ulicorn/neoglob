<p>Documenting this here because Mozilla's docs are bullshit. I have no idea how much kool-aid is needed to actually try and develop extensions for this crock of shit…</p>

<p>For some time now, you can't seem to save settings you make in the security devices settings. (To be exact: you can see them added to the NSS database, but on restarting your thunderbird/firefox, your NSS database is overwritten with one only containing the default entries. Removing permissions fro the relevant database files in the profile directory only leads to the software ignoring them.)</p>

<p>Anyway, so find a elevated javascript console (in thunderbird, that's Ctrl-Shift-J) and paste</p>

<pre><code>Components.classes["@mozilla.org/security/pkcs11;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPKCS11).addModule("p11autoproxy", "/usr/lib64/p11-kit-proxy.so", 0, 0); 
Components.classes["@mozilla.org/security/pk11tokendb;1"].getService(Components.interfaces.nsIPK11TokenDB).findTokenByName("PIV_II (PIV Card Holder pin)").login(true);
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, the name might be different for you – if you manually add the device through the GUI, it's the string listed as "Label".</p>

<p>Next on the list: find out how to either force this early enough in the startup process or to automatically re-select the certs to use for signatures for certain accounts.</p>
