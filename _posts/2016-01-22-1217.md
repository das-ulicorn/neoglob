<p>(the gift that keeps giving?)

I woke up with a "Dreadlock Holiday" earworm this morning. You don't have to thank me, you're welcome.
<br/>

Also, of course the mail exchange needs to go like this:
Me: "I'll send you my public key, can you add that to some user so I can see the error logs"
Him: "I've made you root"
Me: "BwahahahahAHAHAHA KNEEL BEFORE ME PUNY EARTHLINGS!"</p>
