title: "ooops, awkward."

<p>so it's sunday. what _I_ was doing at work was: surreptitiously swapping my faulty fluorescent tube for one from a lecture hall. because that's way simpler than findin out which of our three sections with "maintenance" in the name is responsible and then have a caretaker shoo me out of my office during working hours.
<br/>
what head of IT was doing: moving things between filing cabinets to throw out the old one. unfortunately, i had picked the lecture hall next to his office. on the plus side, i had already put in the old tube so it was just a "wait and hope he doesn't look in here or what?" thing.</p>
