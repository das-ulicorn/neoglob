<p>Tonight's little annoyance: <code>at -V</code> will report the time it understands for a job in the form of <code>date  +'%a %b %d %H:%m:%S %Y'</code>, i.e. <code>Mon Dec 13 19:12:58 2010</code>.</p>

<p>You have one try to guess what is <em>not</em> a valid input format for the time. *sigh*</p>

<p>And whatever happened to the combined cron/at daemon that's been an obvious task for decades now? Nevermind RFC 2445/5545 input...</p>
