title: "It's winter, are you ready?"

<p>As of today, we're back on a non-S timezone. I seem to be a nerd, because I spent that hour reading about the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/hinting/tutorial.htm">truetype hinting bytecode language</a> in a tutorial that is almost 20 years old now.
<br/>
In other various odds and ends: zeppelins are reverse bouncy castles, the onion crisis is apparently over, I've caught up with the BBC, and there was something else but I've forgotten.
<br/>
[ETA: <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/song/the-winter-song-mt0001272047">music reference</a>, one of the many interesting songs I've come across in the clearance bin before World Of Music closed.]</p>
