<p>Grails' <code>converter.XML</code> doesn't set the encoding of the response to UTF-8.
Apparently, the default (as far as Tomcat is concerned) is latin-1, so just saying</p>

<pre><code>render myThing as XML
</code></pre>

<p>gives you something which throws encoding barfage, while </p>

<pre><code>render (text:myThing as XML,contentType: 'text/xml', encoding: 'utf-8')
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>response.setCharacterEncoding('utf-8')
render myThing as XML
</code></pre>

<p>work. Sidenote: <code>wget --server-response</code> does apparently not show the entire response, the encoding is conveniently cut off.</p>
