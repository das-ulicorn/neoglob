title: "Day 2b: zombie weather"

<p>i.e. it raaaaaains, so I'm back inside even though it's only 1:20pm, because the constant drizzle is just wearing me down, pearl izumi jacket or no. (Also, it's slightly cooler today and I fancy a mince pie and hot tea.)
<br/>
Not seen so far: the "Finding Dory" kids' menu offer (fish fingers and chips) because I'm mean that way. Spent 74p on gambling. Watched some of the bowls semifinals, realized I don't understand the scoring.
<br/>
Also, what's this thing with brits and weather? A good day out for a brit seems to be mucking around with a metal detector along the beach while getting third-degree sunburn. Unfortunately, the weirdly-shaped canopy over the bowling ground benches, which yesterday at least provided some shade, was not designed to provide shelter against rain when combined with even the mildest of breezes.
<br/>
I'm sure there's more, but first, there's tea.
<br/>
ETA: rain let up around 4-ish, went out in search of the local games store, which looked a. closed and b. games-workshop-only. 
<br/>
Oh, and some home news joke: Kiel is in talks to get twinned with San Francisco. I know which side is getting the rougher deal with that. :D</p>
