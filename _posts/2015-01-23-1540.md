<p>things that would be useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>tracking time spent per page (on devcopy), see apache log flag <code>%d</code>, between old code and new</li>
<li>using realistic access patterns. To this end, take existing logfile from production, giving us vhost and path. Replay on devcopy, log the returned Mimetypes, see apache log flag <code>%{Content-Type}o</code>. Drop all CSS, JS, that's page requisites. (Assume everything else isn't, which means we have a few pictures too many on the new code.) Then get the list of content with <code>wget</code>, see <code>--page-requisites</code> option. Think about parallelism, but just a fixed number. Small should be enough, because of the single-server devcopy, we're just looking at relative speeds anyway. Tracking bytes transferred between old and new would also be interesting.</li>
</ul>
