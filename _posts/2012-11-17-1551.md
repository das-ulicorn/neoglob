<p>I thought I had seen all the world has to offer in terms of shitty numpads. <a href="http://trust.com/16907">This one, by Trust</a>, sends [Numlock down][Numlock up] before every proper keydown and after every proper keyup. Yes, I guess that's one way to get numbers even when numlock is off. What braindead good-for-nothing freshman got to implement it that way? I guess that's why Woolworth's had it in their clearance bin for 3â‚¬. Avoid.</p>
