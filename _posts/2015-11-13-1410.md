<p>So sunday will be the big network outage that I believe I've mentioned before.
<br/>
I can't believe that nobody else thought of "we should put phones to voicemail saying we have a scheduled outage".
<br/>
OTOH, this might be the most productive thing I did all month so far. I'm sure the BA inflight magazine would call it engineer thinking.</p>
