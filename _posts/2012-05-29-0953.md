<p>In a severe case of "<a href="http://http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/ha-ha-only-serious.html">HHOS</a>", today I hate Grails' defunct sketch of configuration environments, viz.: you can have only three, and you <a href="http://jira.grails.org/browse/GRAILS-4260">cannot configure everything</a> with them. </p>

<p>Like, want to change the port number? Command-line override or un-environmented BuildConfig.</p>

<p>Supposedly, you can check for the environment (see ticket above), but a. that doesn't work, and b. you only get one of the three hardcoded values. WTF?</p>
