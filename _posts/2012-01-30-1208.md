<p><em>We have to go deeper!</em></p>

<p>Our User/Permission Database is just spawning its own internal access control. My head is exploding because "User", "Role", "Service" and "Account" are already objects, so the IAC will have "Access Levels" assigned based on the "Service" and the object you are trying to access. I'm really running out of names.</p>

<p>Also, this let me write the following Groovy snippet:</p>

<pre><code>static mapping = {
  column          column:'column'
}
</code></pre>
