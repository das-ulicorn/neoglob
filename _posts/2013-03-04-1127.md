<p>What are the odds that two users find the same bug on the same day, after it has been present in the code since approx. last October or so? And of course, I had reported that bug back then -- it was introduced as part of Plone security patches and broke existing sites. Nothing ever was heard of that again. The Plone security team did not follow-up, ever. There was an updated version to work around, released silently, without notifying reporters. Of course, this is a horrible workflow and casts a very bad light on Plone. (As if it needed any more of that!)</p>

<p>Oh, and of course, even a quick check of the newer version including the supposed bugfix reveals another related bug. Which I have reported today. I'm so so sick and tired of deploying <code>plone.app.foobar x.y.0pl1</code>'s because of the rancid bits all over the place. </p>

<p>If I reported every "feature" that subtly breaks existing behaviour, I'd never get anything else done. </p>
