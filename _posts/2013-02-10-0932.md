title: "Well that was fun."

<p>Service goes down (which is different from Service "goes down"): 3am-ish (which is different from 3 Amish, which sounds like the beginning of a culturally-insensitive joke.)
I notice, because I'm rolling around in my bed lazily with my laptop (which is much less exicitng than it sounds) and check work email: 8:50am.
I lock the door behind me: 8:51am.
I open the office door: 8:58am.
Service restarted and Nagios has calmed down: 9:05.
<br/>
Well, it's certainly cheaper than coffee.
<br/>
I hadn't planned to go to the gym in the morning, but I'm halfway there and they open at 10, so hey. Downside: I've not had breakfast yet. This'll be fun.</p>
