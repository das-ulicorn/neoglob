<p>So it occurred to me that practicing on a toy would give too little feedback. I think there are lifesize dolls that ambulance staff train CPR on (is that the push-twentyone-twentytwo-push thing? My Webster's helpfully only gave the latin name it expands to), with sensors that will, for example, give a result like "Yeah, OK, patient survived, but you broke three ribs.". Maybe this is needed for oral intercourse as well. "Yeah, OK, next time, don't bite it off, OK?"</p>
