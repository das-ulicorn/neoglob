<p>So we're debating how to introduce better authentication and authorization schemes at work. And we're looking at smartcards, but that involves putting a smartcard reader on everybody's desk. And we're looking at USB tokens, but the ones I like are end-of-sale in May. And we think contactless near-field would be nice, but that involves "putting your keys into the bowl on the table" and I'm not sure I can keep a straight face.</p>
