<p>All I wanted to do is to take a look at <code>plone.app.event</code> to see if their recurring events work yet. But p.a.e depends on alpha versions of <code>plone.app.portlets</code>, the alpha version doesn't have BBB imports for the portlets it doesn't provide anymore, also, it depends on newer versions of <code>plone.app.jquery</code>, the currently newest (1.9 branch) isn't compatible with various other parts of Plone so 1.8 it is, and also it requires <code>plone.app.widgets</code> which breaks all Textfields (by enforcing a certain editor widget and ignoring site settings about that).</p>

<p>So, I can see my Friday going away, all because coredev can't get its act straight.</p>
