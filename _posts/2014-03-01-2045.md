title: "BFFH."
---

<p>I think there are a few things I need to rescue off archive.org, if only to conserve proof that I was not always the evenly-tempered calm person I am today. Two more posts coming, but this one makes the most sense to most of you, since, you know, language and stuff. My then flatmate moved out around 2003, I think, but we'd not really spoken for about a year at that point. These stories, of course, are to be seen in the line of <a href="http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/">Simon Travaglia's Bastard Operator From Hell</a>. I apologize for the formatting -- I've not re-done the formatting left in by copy-and-paste.

<lj-cut text="the bastard flatmate from hell">
<h1 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The Bastard Flatmate From Hell</h1><hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" /><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Disclaimer: these events are purely fictional. Don&#39;t try this at home. No lifeforms or flatmates were hurt during the production of this file.</i><hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" />
<h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Solo for BFFH</h2><h5 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Flattie&#39;s on holiday, but the BFFH won&#39;t get bored</h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">I wake up to the sweet sound of silence. </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Real</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> silence, not the kind that&#39;s disrupted by the stomach-turning snorting that flattie says are attempts to get oxygen to his important parts, wherever he might be hiding those. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">That&#39;s when I realise that flattie&#39;s away, up up and away, in fact, he&#39;s abroad. Unfortunately, he didn&#39;t tell me in advance, so he&#39;ll get there sound and in one piece, since I couldn&#39;t &quot;help packing&quot;. It looks like he&#39;s learning, both of his brain cells working at high speed, working out how there are bomb threats on each train he takes and each customs person takes him for a thorough search. These thoughts console me into rolling around and taking another nap, since it&#39;s only 10am. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">When I finally get up to perform something that superficially resembles making coffee, I realise that, even with some hundred miles between us, he still tries to keep a strangle-hold on the flat in form of his (undone) dishes. What once was muesli is now of a colour and (from the looks) consistency unheard of in dairy produce. </span>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">At a second guess, it might be running for political office by the time flattie&#39;s back. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">On the other hand, he has no way of escaping the wrath of the BFFH, not as long as he has his cellphone with him. The selfsame cellphone whose number has -- by a freak accident that truly must be one in a million, i.e. as likely as flattie washing up -- been listed not in one, not in two, but in six ads of the &quot;Valerie (19) does everything, everywhere, with everybody&quot; variety in today&#39;s newspaper, and one &quot;Breeding Dog needed for Bitch&quot; ad that slipped into the wrong category, to keep things spicy. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">It is, of course, unfortunate for flattie that he didn&#39;t read his cellphone contract carefully enough - - the callers only pay national charges, any cost beyond that will on his next cellphone bill.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">To be frank, since it is the 29th of the month and the bill is automatically paid out of his bank account the day after tomorrow, I expect him to have quite red figures there real soon.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Too bad the repo people won&#39;t want his dishes, though... </span>
<br/>
<hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" /><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Vermin extinction</h2><h5 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Where the BFFH strikes, inferior lifeforms don&#39;t stand a chance</h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">I&#39;m bored. </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Really</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> bored. The flattie&#39;s overdue a week, and I don&#39;t believe for a second that life could be nice and let him have, say, a swimming accident. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Anyhow, I&#39;m so bored I decide to do something useful -- there are silver-fish in the bathroom and it&#39;s time to do something about that. So I buy the insecticide and only realize afterwards that I don&#39;t know just where the things are hiding. So I put the decoys there and decide I need to disinfect everything in there, especially those suspicious-looking towels that flattie thinks he needs to have all over the place. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any disinfectant here, but then a blue plastic bottle catches my eye: &quot;Blue Force&quot; pipe detergent, although you almost can&#39;t read the name because of all the warnings on the bottle: &quot;Warning: avoid skin contact, avoid contact with water&quot;, &quot;Warning: pipes may get hot&quot; and whatnot.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">&quot;This&#39;ll surely get rid of any silver-fish poo on the towels&quot; I think to myself, and carefully, very, </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">very</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> carefully pour some over flattie&#39;s shower towel. Of course, I can&#39;t wash the stuff out (</span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">&quot;avoid contact with water&quot;</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">) so I just put it over flattie&#39;s door to let it dry. It surely is a bit more stiff afterwards, but it folds just fine and certainly is clean.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Of course, the towel will probably get </span><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">hot</b><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> in more ways than one when he next uses it, but well, you&#39;ve </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">got</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> to be careful when handling chemicals, and if he doesn&#39;t know that, bad luck.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Besides, a lot of people pay a lot of money for skin peelings and the like, and he gets it all for free. I really don&#39;t know why he&#39;s complaining all the time.</span>
<br/>
<hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" /><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Food</h2><h5 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The kitchen may be a terrible maze to some, but to the BFFH it&#39;s just another battlefield. What coincidence...</h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">It&#39;s just after 10 o&#39;clock when I finally decide to roll out of my bed. The air smells fresh and free of incompetence and luserdom, so, I conclude, flattie must already be off to uni.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">I put the kettle on for some coffee (this being the only action that I&#39;m fit for until I&#39;ve had my fix of instant-with-milk), take my milk carton out of the fridge, take his milk out of the fridge, put his on the window sill in the sun, mine into the black caffeine solution in the mug and start shaking as the coffee works its way into my bloodstream, turns the ignition of my brain, sets the car radio to loud music and heads for the next autobahn.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">I am confused to see a teabag -- his teabag -- resting on top of my jar of truly delicious cranberry-and-orange jam, so I check the cupboard and find flattie bought himself new tea bags (after some very strange mixup in the factory had his last box of teabags contain mustard powder instead of tea. You&#39;d think he&#39;d learn not to put his teabags on my jars to form modern sculptures there). </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">He&#39;s chronically low on minerals (you can tell because he is very shaky and starts everytime he sees me), so I decide I should do something for his calcium input. I pry open the tea bags and go back to my room to get my Box of Bastardry. Patience is a virtue -- after six months of collecting, I have enough toenail clippings to fill up each of the 40 teabags. I staple the bags closed and put them back into the cupboard. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">He really is unlucky with teabags, but should he ever switch to coffee, the DIY store has a special offer on gardening soil.</span>
<br/>
<hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" /><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Current affairs</h2><h5 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Of course you could just prod flattie with the soldering iron...</h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">In a heroic effort to keep myself educated, I have decided to practise my electric skills once more. Today&#39;s pet project involves a small loudspeaker -- flattie conveniently &quot;donated&quot; the one in his cellphone -- and some passive leftovers from the same place (After all, a cellphone without a speaker is a bit silly).</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Of course, I&#39;m starting on an easy one: it takes only a bit of wiring to generate a high humming noise, not unlike that of a mosquito.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">This is nice, but completely unusable at this stage, since the volume doesn&#39;t vary and hence the device is easily found. I resort to browsing through my old electronics handbook, only to stumble over something interesting: apparently, some kinds of LED can function as a light </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">sensor</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">. Now where did I put... there! </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">A quick test proves that indeed the &quot;incoming call&quot; LED will generate a tiny amount of current if exposed to light. Only, mosquitoes are active during the night (as anybody would confirm), so I wire in the LED backwards, so that the hum goes on in the night, gets louder as it gets darker, and stops when it gets light, for example because flattie turns on the bedside lamp &quot;to find that annoying mosquito that has been disturbing his sleep for the last few days&quot;.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Of course, I feel hardly sympathetic -- it was him who could not front up his share of money to buy mosquito nets for the kitchen window, so they probably come in through the kitchen window, down the hall, through his keyhole into his room. Funny, that.</span>
<br/>
<hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" /><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">update: more vermin</h2><h5 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">Remember: Nature is your friend</h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">The silver-fish decoys seem to be working rather well -- I have seen none of the little buggers in the last few days. Of course, flattie&#39;s girlfriend is crashing about the flat at nighttime instead (and </span><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">still</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;"> doesn&#39;t grasp how our worn-out bathroom door works: </span>
<b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Bang!</b><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">flop</i><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Bang!</b><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">flop</i><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">BANG!</b><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">flop</i><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">*BANG!*</b>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">and only then it occurs to her to turn the key to keep the door shut. </span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">But then, nobody with a clue would date flattie, so I shouldn&#39;t be surprised.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Anyhow, with a sudden pang of conscience (ha ha ha) I realize I cannot brutally slaughter innocent silver-fish anymore. However, I don&#39;t want them to re-establish themselves as a kitchen and bathroom force.</span>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">This is where the workings of the decoy come into play: I figure it&#39;s a two step process: i) decoy attracts vermin, ii) vermin eats decoy and dies because it&#39;s poisoned.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">All I want is step i), somewhere not kitchen nor bathroom nor my room. Well, this really doesn&#39;t leave much choice, does it? So I sneak in and install ...ahem... air fresheners in flattie&#39;s room, one under the mattress, the other one behind the wardrobe. Of course, I wrap them in perforated plastic beforehand, so that the smell gets out, but the silver-fish don&#39;t get in, and offer them some flour instead.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">This night, just as I hear the clumsy steps of someone who doesn&#39;t know which floorboards creak and steel myself for an 1am </span><b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Bang!</b><i style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">flop</i><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">-session, somebody screams, jumps up on some bed next door (hit him squarely in the groin with her foot, too, and she&#39; no lightweight), and the next thing I hear are a door, &quot;Don&#39;t expect me to come back to this filthy, bug-ridden place again&quot;, another door, and I know that my nightly rest is no longer endangered.</span>
<br/>
<hr style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;" /><h2 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">The sound of silence</h2><h5 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal;">When the BFFH redresses damage, he does so thoroughly</h5><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">I&#39;m entirely too soft for this.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Flattie is miffed because he can&#39;t find his cellphone anywhere (apparently he got in good standing with the telco again after that sex ad &quot;accident&quot;), and I think he&#39;s starting to suspect something. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s not tried calling it and homing in on the ring tone (which would emerge from under my stereo and I have no idea how to explain that).</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Anyhow, I decide I need to fix it and &quot;accidentally&quot; find it in the chest of drawers in the hall. Only, I can&#39;t, because the speaker is in the electric mosquito in his room. I go shopping trying to think up a solution (it&#39;s amazing how fast you can go through a bottle of vinegar when you don&#39;t share the same toilet paper) when my eyes fall onto the ideal solution:</span>
<br/>
<b style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">A smoke detector !</b>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">Battery-powered, small, cheap and no less than 90 dB in action. Short: it&#39;s a BFFH dream come true. I buy one, dissect it, mount the mechanism in the remains of flattie&#39;s cellphone and replace the sensor cell by a link to the &quot;accept call&quot; button. This doesn&#39;t all quite fit in the case, so I have to have to fiddle a bit with unnecessary details like insulation -- when he gets his next call, he&#39;s going to have a whole lot of problems more urgent than why he&#39;s rapidly discharging the power cells through his body.</span>
<br/>
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; line-height: normal;">&quot;He, flattie! I&#39;ve found your phone! It was in the bottom drawer!&quot;</span>
