<br/>
Wow, a queer coming-of-age movie that manages not to be bi-erasionist, albeit by omission, showing the plot and the characters, and replacing the usual coming out to parents scene in favour of "[cut] parent: So you're in love with two girls?", the "Yeah something like that" being entirely muttered by me sitting in front of the screen.
<br/>
So how does it fall into it all? It's not the saccharine schmaltz of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168987/">Better Than Chocolate</a>, not the unambiguity monosexuality and community stereotyping of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115640/">Beautiful Thing</a>, not the depressing scenery of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097095/">Coming Out</a>, and not the camp cliche of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0420206/">Summer storm</a>. It's just a teenage story about a boy who loves a girl and another boy.
Just something that makes you say "yes, that's true".
<br/>
Oh, and a good soundtrack. (fittisatan anarkikommando!)</p>
