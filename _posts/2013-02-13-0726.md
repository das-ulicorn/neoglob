title: "Well that was fun, Episode V: the fileserver strikes back."

<p>Today, it was the fileserver that serves our webservers. Or didn't, because it was down as I arrived. I would like to say it reanimated itself upon a good hard Paddington stare, but I think it's just the fs check that finished just as I was doing final checks to do the failover. (Also known as: "why is the number of critical services down to 50 from 100 suddenly?".)

ETA: it gets better and better. "But we've been promised there'd be PDF export" -- "Well, you've been lied to." -- "*stamps foot*". Well, the middle part is only happening in my head.
<br/>
And: "yes, that video wrapper works, but not on my iPad!1!!" 
Well sucks to be you.</p>
