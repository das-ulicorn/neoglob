<p>The last time I felt so awkward and self-conscious going into a shop? Buying porn ten years ago. (Similar behaviour patterns, too: trying to be invisible, not making eye contact, silently scanning the offerings for the thing I came for and trying to not look too closely at the other stuff, much less think about it. Lethargic all-female staff, too, but with less (visible) tats and nicotine habit.)
I've not looked forward to brushing my teeth quite as much for quite a while. ;)
<br/>
And it's not as awful as it could be, really. (I got Atomic, which appeared to be the least controversial one.)</p>
